This is a Spring Boot application designed to log workouts. It was conceived as a standalone data analysis and visualization project, but this backend stage was submitted as my PromineoTech Backend Coding Boot Camp final project. Next steps include the creation of a frontend data entry platform, as well as the data analysis and graphing, once all the painstaking data entry is complete.
